## Role Variables

Please refer to the [defaults file](/defaults/main.yml) for an up to date list of input parameters.

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```
    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: vim
           vim_packages: neovim
```

## Testing

Please make sure your environment has [docker](https://www.docker.com) installed in order to run role validation tests. Additional python dependencies are listed in the [requirements file](https://github.com/nephelaiio/ansible-role-requirements/blob/master/requirements.txt)

This role is tested against the following distributions (docker images):

  * Ubuntu Bionic
  * Ubuntu Xenial
  * Debian Stretch

You can test the role directly from sources using command ` molecule test `
